        <p class="text-muted">
            Pegasus Transport was born from a simple idea — to make travel to and from Arlanda smoother, smarter,
            and more personal. What started as a small local project quickly grew into a dedicated team determined
            to build something that combines technology, reliability, and human connection. Every trip we drive
            represents more than a journey between two points — it’s a promise of comfort, punctuality, and trust.

                <h5>From Classroom to Code</h5>

                <p class="mb-0">
                    Pegasus began as a student initiative — an idea that turned into a real-world transport solution.
                    With roots in system development and a shared passion for modern mobility, our team built a
                    platform that bridges classic taxi service with innovative digital booking. From backend logic
                    to the user-friendly booking page, every line of code carries our story forward on four wheels.

        <h3 class="fw-semibold mb-3">Why Pegasus?</h3>
        <p class="text-muted">
            We believe travel should be effortless. Pegasus was created for those who value precision,
            comfort, and care — especially when heading to or from Sweden’s busiest airport. Our system ensures
            all bookings are made in advance, routes are optimized, and every passenger feels secure from
            the moment they click “Book” to the moment they arrive.
        </p>

        <h3 class="fw-semibold mb-3 mt-5">Our Vision</h3>
        <p class="text-muted">
            To redefine airport transport through innovation and empathy. Pegasus Transport strives to make every
            journey simple, sustainable, and stress-free — powered by technology, driven by people, and built
            for the future of travel.
