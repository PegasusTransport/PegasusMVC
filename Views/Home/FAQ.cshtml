                        Pegasus Transport offers <strong>fixed prices to and from Arlanda Airport</strong>.
                        <br><br>
                        Within the official Arlanda zone, our prices follow
                        <strong>Swedavia’s recommended pricing guidelines</strong> to ensure fairness and transparency.
                        <br><br>
                        If your pickup or drop-off address is <strong>outside the Arlanda zone</strong>,
                        the price is calculated using the taximeter until your trip reaches the fixed-price zone.
                        Once inside the zone, the fixed price is added.
                        <br><br>
                        The price you see during booking is always the <strong>final price</strong> —
                        it already includes both the fixed zone price and any taximeter distance required to reach it.

                        For example, if you book a 04:00 pickup, your driver will arrive around 03:50
                        and wait until 04:10 before waiting-time fees apply.
